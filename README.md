vBully is an auto-exploiter for the ForumRunner vulnerability (CVE-2016-6195). This work is based on the work of Manish Kishan Tanwar AKA error1046 (https://twitter.com/IndiShell1046). This tool has the expanded ability to parse the results post-SQL-Injection and grab the dumped user table hashes. It then saves the hashes to a file and proceeds to crack (dictionary attack) the password hashes based on the `md5(md5(password).salt)` formula used by vBulletin.
